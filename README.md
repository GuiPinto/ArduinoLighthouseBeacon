# ArduinoLighthouseBeacon
A super flexible IR remote controllable animated lighthouse beacon

I built a lighthouse bookshelf / lamp for my little guy's nautical themed nursery, and decided to go the extra mile and make a remote controlled LED beacon for it.

And here is a video of the beacon in action!
